Hello, my name is Tyler Gore, and I am a proficient independent software developer and an accomplished EMT. Shortly after graduating from high school, I pursued EMT training at VoTech. During my studies, I concurrently held a position as a gymnastics coach and selflessly volunteered as a firefighter.

      After completing EMT school, I secured a position as an EMT and served in this capacity for two years before meeting my significant other. We subsequently tied the knot within a year and expeditiously relocated to Texas. It was during this time that I discovered my passion for software development and commenced my online learning journey under the guidance of seasoned software engineers.

     
While in the process of obtaining my Texas state EMS license, I began my career at Amazon as a driver. Upon successfully receiving my Texas EMS license, I returned to the EMS field and worked as an EMT while also collaborating on software projects for my personal clientele. I remain committed to both software development and the EMS industry, and continue to find fulfillment in both arenas. To this day I have multiple websites, and clients of my own of which I built and manage websites.
